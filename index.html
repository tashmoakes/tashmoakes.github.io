      <h3>Opinion: why you should care for dead troncos until the bitter end</h3>
        <h4>Because sometimes things look dead when actually they still have some life deep within them...</h4>  
          <p>Think of beetles and spiders playing dead.  Really all they're feeling is fear but they actually want some TLC.  So gather up the love you've got to give while I tell you about how to water something until it start's growing mold.  First, get yourself down the local tezzers andd buy one of those silly smoothies with the hats on...</p>
